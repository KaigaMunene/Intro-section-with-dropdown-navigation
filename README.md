## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - lets you run automated builds of your website with each Git commit using CI/CD pipeline designed for web developers

### How to run Sass without using watch sass

- Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) - is the world's largest Software Registry
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
- For development run:

```
npm run sass-dev
```

- For production run:

```
npm run sass-prod
```

- Install [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) - is an open-source Javascript linting utility that helps you write better JavaScript.
- Install [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - is a tool to format JavaScript code.
